Hello!

Thank you for letting us deliver our assignment later than we should have,
it took some time to get everything in order. We started over again 
a couple of times but finally found a solution that worked very good.
In order for the project to work locally, run "npm install" 
in a terminal in the root folder of the project.

Hope you like it!
